-----
When run without command line arguments, the application will scan the USB 
ports to identify and communicate with USB/HDMI interface board over USB.
 
If it does not find a USB connection it will scan the COM ports, automatically 
detect the Harrier Evaluation Kit Board and identify the port type 
(RS-232, RS-485 or TTL) over which the Harrier camera interface board
is connected. 

Once a valid connection is found it will then report the camera type, 
firmware versions, and display a simple text based menu system that allows
the user to select from a set of common setting/inquiry VISCA commands 
that can be sent to the camera and interface board.

If the application is run with specific COM port and baud rate specified 
on the command line but no parameters it will look for cameras on that COM port.
e.g. HarrierControl COM6 9600
This enables use of HarrierControl with Harrier cameras that 
do not have a Camera Interface board. 
-----
HarrierControl.exe can also be used to read and write USB/HDMI interface board 
USB camera firmware/configuration including the Harrier USB serial number.

Command line argument: 
'HarrierControl.exe USB3 GetSerial' reads the serial number (caps sensitive).
'HarrierControl.exe USB3 SetSerial Example123' sets the serial number to "Example123", serial numbers can contain up to 31 numerals and/or ordinary characters.
'HarrierControl.exe USB3 SaveConfig FileName.ext' saves the current USB/HDMI board configuration to "Filename.ext". A filename extension is not mandatory.
'HarrierControl.exe USB3 LoadConfig FileName.ext' loads the previously saved board configuration to the filename specified.
'HarrierControl.exe USB3 LoadConfig FileName.ext SetSerial SerialNumber' loads the configuration and sets the serial number to "SerialNumber"

Writing non-standard characters to the serial number can cause the device 
to become unreadable and the device may no longer be able to be re-configured (bricked).
Writing anything other than the configuration files provided and serial number 
generated by Active Silicon USB configuration batch files will invalidate your warranty.
